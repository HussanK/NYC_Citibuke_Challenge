# Citibike Usage in NYC
## Purpose
Most clearly this is a challenge to help us gain a better understanding of Tableau. Not only that but it also assisted us in using Pandas to clean our data before feeding the data
into a data visualization software such as Tableau. This can clearly be seen in a more standard workplace setting as most of the data given to us wouldn't be in the formats most
easily understandable. Also, this challenge help us look at data and put it into a story, or even just teaches us to explain the data in ways that are most easily understable. 
## Results
Using the given data, we were able to determine several things. Firstly, in the below charts. Knowing the majority of users is male. We can see the majority of trips have a duration of under thirty minutes. This would lead us to believe that the are being used as a means of travel as opposed to usage for exercise or lesiure.

Secondly in the next set of charts, we can see the majority of trips start in the city and spread out more as the trips end. As the majority of the population lives in the city
and works elsewhere, this data can help support this. There are somme outliers but those can mostly be ignored.

Lastly, and most importantly, we can see that the primary users are both subscirbed and using the bike during the average times to leave for work and during the workday.

## Conclusion
Given the data we can exptrapolate that the majority of users are using as a mean of travel to work. This could hepl Citibike better optimize bikes for workers, or even create a 
new style of bike better sutied to a 9-5 employee. Two other visualization I would have are start and end locations based on time. This can be done with our current data, and 
would further show this point, but could potentially disprove it. I would also recommend maybe seeing if the data for average income of users would be available as that could 
also assist in create new and useful visualizations.
